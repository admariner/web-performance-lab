    <h1>Preload Scanner Examples</h1>

    <h2>Reference Example</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="reference.html">reference.html</a> showcases the usage of the
      preload scanner to efficiently load multiple resources in parallel.<br />
      It demonstrates the benefits of using preload and prefetch techniques to
      optimize page performance.
    </p>

    <h2>Lazy Loading Image Example</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="lazy_loading_image.html">lazy_loading_image.html</a> demonstrates
      the behavior of lazy loading images in relation to the preload scanner.<br />
      It shows that lazy-loaded images are not pre-loaded in parallel and
      highlights the trade-off between lazy loading and pre-loading techniques.
    </p>

    <h2>Injecting Image Example</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="inject_image.html">inject_image.html</a> illustrates the impact
      of dynamically injecting elements, like images via JavaScript, on the
      preload scanner.<br />
      It reveals that dynamically injected images are not detected by the
      preload scanner and are not pre-loaded in parallel with other resources.
