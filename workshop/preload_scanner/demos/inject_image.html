      <h1>Injecting Elements and Preload Scanner</h1>
      <p>
        The demo shows that dynamically injecting elements, like images via
        JavaScript, won't be pre-loaded in parallel by the preload scanner.
      </p>

      <h2>Implications:</h2>
      <p>
        Dynamically injected images are not detected by the preload scanner and
        are not included in the parallel loading process.
      </p>

      <h2>Considerations:</h2>
      <p>
        Developers should carefully balance dynamic element injection and
        pre-loading strategies for optimal performance.
