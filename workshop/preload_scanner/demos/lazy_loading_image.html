      <h1>Lazy Loading and Preload Scanner</h1>
      <p>
        The demo shows that lazy loading objects like images won't be pre-loaded
        in parallel by the preload scanner.

      <h2>Summary:</h2>
      <p>
        Lazily loading images defers their loading until they are about to be
        visible, but they are not pre-loaded in parallel.
      </p>

      <h2>Implications:</h2>
      <p>
        Lazy-loaded images are not detected by the preload scanner and are not
        included in the parallel loading process.
      </p>

      <h2>Considerations:</h2>
      <p>
        Developers should carefully balance lazy loading and pre-loading based
        on performance goals and resource optimization.
      </p>
